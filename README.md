## 🧠 Step 1 – Computational Thinking: Study Planner Automation  
A **Study Planner System** was designed with:

- Problem Definition  
- Algorithm (Pseudocode)  
- Flowchart (hand-drawn / digital)  

This system helps categorize tasks into:
- **Today's Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks**
- **Overdue Tasks**

## 🐧 Step 2 – Linux & Automation  
This step includes two components:

### ✔ Linux Commands  
10 essential Linux commands were executed covering:
- File handling  
- Directory management  
- Permissions  
- Listing & navigation  

(Screenshots included in final report)

### ✔ Bash Script  
A file automation script (`setup_study_folders.sh`) was created to generate a structured folder system for academic planning.

📁 Script File: `setup_study_folders.sh`
